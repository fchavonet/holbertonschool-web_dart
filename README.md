# Web - Dart

## Description

This repository contains my learning projects for the Dart programming language as part of the Holberton School Web Curriculum.

Each folder represents a standalone module focused on understanding the basics of Dart syntax, functions, and core programming concepts.

The projects cover topics such as data types, string manipulation, assertions, recursion, classes, and asynchronous programming, all essential foundations for Flutter and web application development.
